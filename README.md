# COL362 - MNCTwitter

## Project Proposal

Our project involves making a web-based application similar to twitter where users can post their opinions on top MNCs (Apple, Google Inc, Amazon, Tesla Inc, Microsoft).

We will include functionalities:

- [ ] Create/Delete account
- [ ] Posting new tweets (for 1 or more MNCs)/Deleting old tweets
- [ ] Follow/Unfollow users
- [ ] Like/Retweet/Comment on/Report tweets
- [ ] Reading tweets for (filtered) companies and see **new** comments on tweets
- [ ] Find recommended mutual followers
- [ ] Analysing the users own tweets, which were most liked/replied/etc
- [ ] Look at the trending graphs of companies
- [ ] Network analysis for followers

Assumptions: 

1. All users have 0 followers
2. No tweet has been reported
3. No current user have liked/retweeted/commented on any tweets
